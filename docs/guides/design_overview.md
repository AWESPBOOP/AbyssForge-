# Design Overview

## Architectural pillars

1. **Deterministic Core**: Every subsystem (generation, physics, rendering) uses deterministic random streams and snapshotting to ensure reproducible simulations.
2. **Modular Backends**: Rendering, physics acceleration, and I/O pipelines are abstracted behind interfaces so platform-specific implementations can coexist.
3. **Data-Oriented Simulation**: Hot loops operate on structure-of-arrays data, enabling efficient SIMD and GPU execution.
4. **Editor-centric UX**: Node-based generation graph, destruction tool palette, and cinematic capture suite form the central user experience.

## Subsystems

### Procedural Generation

- **Stellar Context**: Generates star parameters (type, luminosity, age) using astrophysical priors.
- **Planet Formation**: Models accretion, migration, and composition layering.
- **Geology & Climate**: Plate tectonics, erosion, hydrology, atmosphere chemistry, and climate modelling share a common data graph for iterative refinement.
- **Biosphere**: Optional life simulation seeded via climate suitability maps.

### Physics Simulation

- Hybrid CPU/GPU N-body integrators (Hermite, symplectic, adaptive Runge-Kutta).
- Collision resolver with shock heating, fragmentation, and debris disk formation.
- Checkpoint & rewind system storing delta-compressed state snapshots.

### Rendering

- Vulkan/Metal/DX12 renderer with atmospheric scattering, ocean shading, volumetric clouds, and cinematic camera rigs.
- LOD-managed planet meshes with tessellation and displacement mapping.
- Destruction visual effects (thermal bloom, debris trails, volumetric explosions) executed via compute/graphics pipelines.

### Tooling & Extensibility

- Plugin registry, scripting API, and scenario serialization.
- Deterministic replay for experiments and education.
- Multiplayer optional module with authoritative server.

## Data formats

- **Metadata**: JSON with explicit units.
- **Textures**: EXR/TIFF.
- **Meshes**: glTF/FBX/OBJ exports.
- **Checkpoints**: Binary delta with SHA-256 integrity.

## Roadmap summary

- **Phase 1**: Core engine scaffolding, deterministic tests, CLI prototype (this repo).
- **Phase 2**: Rendering sandbox, node editor, VR-lite prototype.
- **Phase 3**: GPU physics acceleration, full destruction toolkit, multiplayer preview.
- **Phase 4**: Production polish, localization, accessibility audits, installers.
