# Roadmap

| Phase | Timeline | Highlights |
|-------|----------|------------|
| 1. Foundations | Q1 | Core engine scaffolding, deterministic generation seed system, CLI prototype, plugin registry MVP. |
| 2. Visualization | Q2 | Vulkan renderer, atmosphere & ocean shading, cinematic camera suite, node-based editor alpha. |
| 3. Destruction & Physics | Q3 | GPU-accelerated N-body, collision/fragmentation pipeline, destruction toolkit, VR-lite preview. |
| 4. Multiplayer & Sharing | Q4 | Authoritative multiplayer sessions, scenario browser, cloud sharing integration. |
| 5. Production | Q1 (next year) | Installers, localization, accessibility polish, educational curriculum support. |

Dependencies and risks:

- Hiring GPU/Vulkan specialists for advanced rendering.
- Access to astrophysics SMEs for validation.
- Certification on VR platforms (SteamVR, OpenXR) pending hardware QA.

Contributors are encouraged to align feature work with roadmap milestones and update this document via PRs when scope evolves.
